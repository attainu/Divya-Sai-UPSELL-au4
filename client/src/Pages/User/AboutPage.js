                                Hi guys, I’m Raveena – the owner of Just Cakes Bakeshop.

                                It’s been a journey to get here, and one of my most important core values is transparency and openness. I have always wanted to conduct my business in a way that was genuine, passionate, and exuding love at every single step. So – I want to share a little bit about myself – so you get to know the story behind Just Cakes. Here goes.
                                When I was sixteen, in high school, I felt isolated, insecure, and alone. Dark thoughts consumed my life for nearly two years. I didn’t feel worthy of being on this planet, truly. But then – I discovered baking. I had always loved working with my hands as a kid – my mother would often bring me and my sisters craft sets and other activities so we wouldn’t watch too much television.
                                One day, she and my sister brought home a piping set. So, we made a cake – it was a boxed vanilla cake mix with chocolate filling, and I used a ziplock bag with the corner cut off as a piping bag to create a basketweave icing effect that I saw on Google. Needless to say, after that cake – I was absolutely hooked on the art.
                                From then on, I was obsessed. I watched Food Network shows and Cake Boss incessantly. I watched YouTube tutorials until the wee hours of the morning just trying to soak in this world of baking in. And for the remainder of my high school career, anything I could make into a cake I did (from the periodic table of elements to a Spanish amusement park to the phospholipid bilayer … I caked whatever I could.)
                                 I finally felt confident. I finally felt I was getting good at something. I found my home in the kitchen.
